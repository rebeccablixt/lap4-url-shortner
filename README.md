# URL Shorties

24 hour challenge. Users should be able to enter a url into an input box on the website's front page. The backend will then generate a shortened path at which a User can access their url. If User tries to access the website with a path stored in the database, they should get rerouted to the URL it relates to. If User tries to access the website with a path not stored in the database, they should get rerouted to the homepage where they can create a new short URL.
